2stream wrappers for Python
=====================================

This package provides Python wrappers for the 2stream radiative transfer model by Bernard Pinty. The original Fortran code was downloaded form `here <http://fapar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/WWW/Data/Pages/FAPAR_Software/FAPAR_Software_RTModels_two-stream.php?blnJS=0>`_. The model is described in `Pinty *et al.* (2006) <http://dx.doi.org/10.1029/2005JD005952>`_, the full reference being

code::

Please visit the `Two Stream webpage <http://fapar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/WWW/Data/Pages/FAPAR_Software/FAPAR_Software_RTModels_two-stream.php?blnJS=0>`_ for conditions and restrictions in using this software. Remember to cite and acknowledge the authors of the original model.
